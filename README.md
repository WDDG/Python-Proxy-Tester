# Python based Proxy Tester.
## Test your proxies.
###### Developer: @bopped /// [My Twitter](https://twitter.com/Backdoorcook).

## Info:

- Python 2 *as of now*

- Proxies must be in double quotes --  **"ip:port"** 

- Sites must be in double quotes, as well as have http / https in the beginning! --  **"http://www.adidas.com/us/"** 

- Please look at the examples (sites.json,proxies.json). 

----- USER:PASS Auth'ed proxies -----
- Proxies must be in "username:password@ip:port" format. 

- If your proxies are "ip:port:username:password" use: [Proxy Sorter](https://github.com/bopped/Python-Proxy-Sorter).

- Last proxy must **NOT** have a comma at the end 

- Last Site must **NOT** have a comma at the end 
-------------------------------------
## Modules Needed:
* Requests

* Colorama 

## Help Me. 

- If you don't know how to install modules - 
1. Make sure python _**2**_ is installed! 
2. Open terminal / Command Prompt, and type pip. 
3. If no errors are presented, you can go on and type the following: pip install requests colorama.
4. If you are on mac, you may need to do: sudo pip install requests colorama. 
5. If Errors are present, please refer to Google. 


## Key 

- Green Highlighted Proxy = Proxy is working.

- Yellow Highlighted Proxy = Proxy is working but could not get a 200 response code. Re-test in a couple moments. 

- Red : Proxy returned an error. 


## Troubleshooting

- If you get the error "SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'", this means you have Python 3 installed.

## Bugs:
- DM me on twitter.

###### Disclaimer:
- In no way do I say "This is the best way to test proxies". 
- This is just a fast/easy way to test proxies.
- I am not responsible what you do.
